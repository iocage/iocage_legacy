Clones
------

When a jail is cloned, iocage creates a ZFS clone filesystem.
In a nutshell clones are cheap lightweight writable snapshots.

A clone depends on its source snapshot and filesystem.
If you'd like to destroy the source jail and preserve its clones
you need to promote the clone first, otherwise the source jail cannot be destroyed.

Create a clone
++++++++++++++

To clone www01 to www02 run:

``iocage clone www01 tag=www02``

To clone a jail from an existing snapshot:

``iocage clone www01@snapshotname tag=www03``

Promoting a clone
+++++++++++++++++

**To promote a cloned jail, simply run:**

``iocage promote UUID|TAG``

The above step will reverse the clone and source jail relationship.
Basically the clone will become the source and the source jail will be demoted to a clone.

**Now you can remove the demoted jail with:**

``iocage destroy UUID|TAG``

Updating jails
--------------

Updates are handled with the freebsd-update(8) utility. Jails can be updated
while they are stopped or running.

To update a jail to latest patch level run:

``iocage update UUID|TAG``

This will create a back-out snapshot of the jail automatically.

When finished with updating and the jail is working OK, simply remove the snapshot:

``iocage snapremove UUID|TAG@snapshotname``

In case the update breaks the jail, simply revert back to the snapshot:

``iocage rollback UUID|TAG@snapshotname``

If you'd like to test updating without affecting a jail, create a clone and
update the clone the same way as outlined above.

To clone run:

``iocage clone UUID|TAG tag=testupdate``

Upgrading jails
---------------

Upgrades are handled with the freebsd-update(8) utility.
By default the upgrade command will try to upgrade the jail
to the hosts RELEASE version (uname -r).

Based on the jail "type" property, upgrades are handled differently
for basejails and non basejails.

Upgrade non-basejail
++++++++++++++++++++

To upgrade a normal jail (non basejail) to the hosts RELEASE run:

``iocage upgrade UUID|TAG``

This will upgrade the jail to the same RELEASE as the host.

To upgrade to a specific release run:

``iocage upgrade UUID|TAG release=10.1-RELEASE``

Upgrade basejail
++++++++++++++++

To upgrade a basejail:

Verify whether the jail is a basejail:

``iocage get type UUID|TAG``

Should return type "basejail".

The upgrade can be forced while the jail is online with executing:

  ``iocage upgrade UUID|TAG``

This will forcibly re-clone the basejail filesystems while the jail is running (no downtime) and update the jails /etc with the changes from the new RELEASE.

``iocage set release=10.1-RELEASE UUID|TAG``

This will cause the jail to re-clone its filesystems from 10.1-RELEASE on next jail start. This will not update the jails /etc files with changes from the next RELEASE.

Auto boot
---------

Make sure ``iocage_enable="YES"`` is set in ``/etc/rc.conf``.

To enable a jail to auto-boot during a boot, simply run:

``iocage set boot=on UUID|TAG``

Boot priority
+++++++++++++

Boot order can be specified by setting the priority value:

``iocage set priority=20 UUID|TAG``

Lower value means higher boot priority.

Snapshot management
-------------------

iocage supports transparent ZFS snapshot management out of the box.
Snapshots are point-in-time copies of data, a safety point to which a jail can be reverted at any time.
Initially snapshots take up almost no space as only changing data is recorded.

List snapshots for a jail with:

``iocage snaplist UUID|TAG``

To create a new snapshot run:

``iocage snapshot UUID|TAG``

This will create a snapshot based on current time.

If you'd like to create a snapshot with custom naming run:

``iocage snapshot UUID|TAG@mysnapshotname``

Resource limits
---------------

iocage can enable optional resource limits for a jail. The outlined procedure should provide enough for
a decent starting point.

Limit core or thread
++++++++++++++++++++

Limit a jail to a single thread or core number 1:

``iocage set cpuset=1 UUID|TAG``
``iocage start UUID|TAG``

List applied rules
++++++++++++++++++

List applied limits:

``iocage limits UUID|TAG``

Limit DRAM use
++++++++++++++

Limit a jail to 4G DRAM memory use (limit RSS memory use can be done on-the-fly):

``iocage set memoryuse=4G:deny UUID|TAG``

Turn on resource limits
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Turn on resource limiting for jail:

``iocage set rlimits=on UUID|TAG``

Apply limits
++++++++++++

Apply limit on-the-fly:

``iocage cap UUID|TAG``

Check limits
++++++++++++

Check active limits:

``iocage limits UUID|TAG``

Limit CPU use by %
++++++++++++++++++

Limit CPU execution to 20%:

``iocage set pcpu=20:deny UUID|TAG``
``iocage cap UUID|TAG``

Check limits:

``iocage limits UUID|TAG``

Resetting a jail's properties
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you have many properties on a jail that you would like to reset back to defaults, iocage easily allows that!

To reset to defaults:

``iocage reset UUID|TAG``

You can also reset every jail to the default properties:

``iocage reset ALL``

Resetting a jail will retain the jails UUID and TAG. Everything else will be lost. Make sure to set any custom properties back that you need. If you have set anything via ``iocage set PROPERTY default`` You have nothing left to do!

Automatic package installation
------------------------------

Packages can be installed automatically at creation time!

Specify the ``pkglist`` property at creation time, which should point to a text file
containing one package name per line. Please note you need to have Internet
connection for this to work as ``pkg install`` will try to get the packages from
online repositories.

**Example:**

Create a pkgs.txt file and add package names to it.

``pkgs.txt``:

    ::

        nginx
        tmux

Now simply create a jail and supply the pkgs.txt file:

``iocage create pkglist=/path-to/pkgs.txt tag=myjail``

This will install ``nginx`` and ``tmux`` in the newly created jail.

Using volumes
-------------

Jails can have shared directories from the host which is implemented using nullfs(5). The idea is based on volumes used in the docker world. Files can also be Volumes and are copied over at jail startup.

The ``volumes`` property has the following syntax:
    ::

        /source/path(:/destination/path(:mount_options)) /another/source/path...

``source_path`` is the minimum required input and causes ``destination_path`` to be the same as ``source_path``, but located within the jail's root path.

All options are separated by a colon and multiple volumes can be specified by whitespace separation.
All paths must be absolute and therefore start with a slash.
Optionally comma separated ``mount_options`` can be passed onto the underlying mount command, mostly useful to specify read-only volumes. For files this is done by setting the immutable attribute after copying them into the jail.
Volumes are only mounted during runtime.

Volumes can be added at creation time:

``iocage create volumes="/path/to/some/host/dir:/destination/within/jail/root /other/host/dir:/dest/in/jail:ro" tag=myjail``

or set as a property later:

``iocage set volumes="/new/path:/same/dir:ro" UUID|TAG``

however the ``volumes`` property cannot be changed while the jail is running.
