DESCRIPTION
  iocage is a system administration tool for jails designed to simplify
  jail management tasks. It abstracts away the management of ZFS backed jails
  running VNET or shared IP networking with optional support for resource
  limits.

  Both, shared IP based jails and VNET enabled jails are supported.

  Each jail has a unique ID (UUID) automatically generated at creation time.
  Using the UUID as a jail identifier means that a jail can be replicated in a
  distributed environment with greater flexibility. This also eliminates
  potential naming clashes on large scale deployments and helps reduce
  operator error.

  You can use either the full UUID or a jail's TAG with every operation.

  To ease jail identification a TAG field is included in list mode which can
  be set to any string (hostname, label, note, etc.). By default if unset the
  TAG field contains the creation date and time stamp.

  Properties are stored inside ZFS custom fields. This eliminates the need for
  any configuration files and jails can be easily moved with ZFS send and
  receive preserving all of their properties automatically.

  iocage relies on ZFS and at least one ZFS pool must be present on the host
  system. To enable all the features iocage supports, consider the following
  optional kernel options and system requirements:
    o   FreeBSD 9.3-RELEASE amd64 or higher
    o  Kernel compiled with:

        options         VIMAGE
        options         RACCT
        options         RCTL

  Every command has a -v switch which will allow you to see the how the shell
  is running each of the commands. It's very verbose.

SUBCOMMANDS

  activate ZPOOL

    Intended for automation tools. The pool can be activated for iocage jails
    without requiring user input.

  cap UUID|TAG

    Reapply resource limits on jail while it is running.

  clean [-a|-b|-j]

    This removes the ZFS datasets associated with the flag called. The -a switch
    will destroy everything associated with iocage. The -b switch will destroy
    all bases that have been fetched. Basejails rely on these to exist,
    so be sure you don't use this flag if you have any. The -j switch will
    destroy the jails dataset.

  clone UUID|TAG [UUID|TAG@snapshot] [property=value]

    Clone jail identified by UUID (ZFS clone). All properties will be reset on
    the clone, defaults can be overridden by specifying properties on the fly.
    Custom point-in-time snapshots can be used as a source for cloning in the
    form of UUID@snapshot or TAG@snapshot.

    Examples:

    Clone the current state of the jail:
    iocage clone UUID tag=www02

    Clone a jail from a custom snapshot (snapshot taken previously):
    iocage clone UUID@snapshotname tag=www02

  console UUID|TAG

    Execute login to have a shell inside the jail

  create [-e] [base=[RELEASE|NAME]] [property=value] [property=value] [count=value]

    By default create will deploy a new jail based on the host operating
    system's release. This can be changed by specifying the base option.
    By default a basejail is created that has a common shared base.
    The -e switch will create an empty jail which can be used for unsupported
    or custom jails.

    Example: iocage create tag=www01 pkglist=$HOME/my-pkgs.txt
             iocage create tag=mybasejail
             iocage create tag=mybasejail base=10.2-RELEASE
             iocage create tag=mycustombasejail base=nginx_postgres

    By default only one jail will be created, but if you specify count=NUMBER,
    then that many jails will be created.

    Example: iocage create tag="mybasejail" host_hostname="mybasejail" count=10

    This will create 10 jails with the tag mybasejail_{1-10}. The tag and
    hostname will be incremented up with the number of jails you wish to create.

  deactivate ZPOOL

    Remove the comment that iocage uses to locate a usable pool.

  defaults

    Display all defaults set in the default dataset.

  destroy [-f] UUID|TAG

    Destroy given jail. This is irreversible, use with caution. If the jail is
    running destroy action will fail.

    With -f the jail will be destroyed without confirmation.

  df

    List disk space related information. Available fields:

    CRT - compression ratio
    RES - reserved space
    QTA - disk quota
    USE - used space
    AVA - available space
    TAG - jail name

  exec [-u username | -U username] UUID|TAG|ALL command [arg ...]

    Execute command inside the jail. This is simply an iocage UUID/tag wrapper
    for jexec(8).

  export UUID|TAG

    Export a complete jail. An archive file is created in /iocage/images with
    SHA256 checksum. Jail must be in stopped state before exporting.

  fetch [-P|-p|--ports] [release=RELEASE | ftphost=ftp.hostname.org |
        ftpdir=/dir/ | ftpfiles="base.txz doc.txz lib32.txz src.txz"]

    Used for downloading and updating/patching releases.

    fetch must be executed as the first command on a pristine system. By
    default fetch will download the host node's RELEASE for deployment. If
    other releases are required, this can be changed by supplying the
    required release property or just selecting the appropriate RELEASE from
    the menu list.

    Example: iocage fetch release=10.1-RELEASE

    fetch can also used to update already downloaded releases. To update a local
    release already present in iocage (iocage list -r) run:

             iocage fetch release=10.1-RELEASE

    This example will apply latest patches to 10.1-RELEASE base.
    Newly created jails or basejails will automatically have the latest
    latest updates applied.

    Specifying -P,-p or --ports to fetch will have it also fetch a ports tree
    that all basejails will share with that base.

  get [-r] property|all UUID|TAG

    Get named property or if "all" keyword is specified dump all properties
    known to iocage.

    To display whether resource limits are enforced for a jail:

    iocage get rlimits UUID|TAG
    iocage get -r rlimits
    iocage get all UUID|TAG

  help

    This help file you are reading.

  import UUID [property=value]

    Import full jail images or differential packages. Images need to be
    present in /iocage/images along with checksum files. You can use short
    UUIDs - do not specify the full filename only the UUID. These jails
    become what we call "thickjails" and are not supported for all operations.

  init-host IP ZPOOL

    Initialize a remote host for iocage. iocage will send all required ZFS
    filesystems over the network to the host. This requires SSH working keys
    installed for root.

  inuse [UUID|TAG]

    Display consumed resources for a jail. Without UUID or TAG dump all
    resources for all running jails in a comma delimited form.

  limits [UUID|TAG]

    Display active resource limits for a jail or all jails. With no UUID
    supplied display all limits active for all jails.

  list [-b|-t|-r]

    List all jails, if -t is specified list only templates,
    with -r list downloaded releases.
    Non iocage jails will be listed only if the jail is running.

  promote UUID|TAG

    Promote a cloned jail to a fully independent copy. For more details please
    read zfs(8).

  rcboot

    Start all jails with "boot" property set to "on". Intended for boot time
    execution. Jails will be started in an ordered fashion based on their
    "priority" property.

  reboot UUID|TAG

    Fully stops the jail with `iocage stop` and, upon success, restarts it with
    `iocage start`.

  rcshutdown

    Stop all jails with "boot" property set to "on". Intended for full host
    shutdown.
    Jails will be stopped in an ordered fashion based on their "priority"
    property.

  reset UUID|TAG|ALL

    This will reset a jail's properties back to the defaults.

    It reads from the properties set on the "default" dataset. TAG, UUID and
    generated vnet mac addresses are carried forward.

    Those will retain their values, even if you reset the jail.
    You can also reset every jail to the default properties by using the
    keyword "ALL".

  restart UUID|TAG

    Soft restart jail. Soft method will restart the jail without destroying
    the jail's networking and the jail process itself. All processes are
    gracefully restarted inside the jail. Useful for quick and graceful
    restarts.

  rollback UUID|TAG@snapshotname

    Rollback to an existing snapshot. Any intermediate snapshots will be
    destroyed. For more information on this functionality please read zfs(8).

  runtime UUID|TAG

    Show runtime configuration of a jail. Useful for debugging.

  set property=value [property=value] UUID|TAG

    Set one or more properties to the supplied value.

  snaplist UUID|TAG

    List all snapshots belonging to jail.

        NAME    - snapshot name
        CREATED - creation time
        RSIZE   - referenced size
        USED    - used space

  snapremove UUID|TAG@snapshotname|ALL

    Destroy specified jail snapshot. If the keyword ALL is specified all
    snapshots will be destroyed for the jail.

  snapshot [-r] UUID|TAG [UUID|TAG@snapshotname]

    Create a ZFS snapshot for jail. If the -r flag is specified it will by
    recursively snapshot POOL/iocage/jails/UUID. Otherwise it will only snapshot
    POOL/iocage/jails/UUID/root. If no snapshot name is specified defaults
    to auto snapshot name based on current date and time.

  start UUID|TAG

    Start jail identified by UUID or TAG.

  stop UUID|TAG|ALL

    Stop jail identified by UUID or TAG. If ALL is specified, it will stop all
    jails.

  uncap UUID|TAG

    Release all resource limits, disable limits on the fly.

  update UUID|TAG

    Will reclone the jail if it is a basejail, otherwise it updates the jail
    to the latest patch level. A back-out snapshot is created to allow
    safe update/rollback.

  upgrade UUID|TAG [release=RELEASE]

    By default this will upgrade jail RELEASE to match the host's RELEASE
    unless another RELEASE is specified with the "release" property.

    Please note: The upgrade process for basejails is done by setting the jail's
    "release" property to the required new RELEASE and then merging /etc.
    If you wish to do this yourself without having /etc merged do:

    iocage set release=10.1-RELEASE UUID|TAG

    For this the RELEASE must be locally available. The basejail
    will re-clone its filesystems from the new release at next jail start.

    WARNING: Cloned jails (deprecated) [-c] are not supported for upgrades.
    Please use thick (deprecated) [-t] or our standard basejails for
    this feature.

  version | --version

    List version number.

PROPERTIES
  For more information on properties please check the relevant man page which
  is noted under each property in the form of "Source: manpage". Source "local"
  marks iocage specific properties.

  pkglist=none | path-to-file

    A text file containing one package per line. These will be auto installed
    when a jail is created. Works only in combination with the create
    subcommand.

    Default: none
    Source: local

  vnet=on | off

    This controls whether to start the jail with VNET or a shared IP
    configuration. Default is to auto-guess from a sysctl. If you don't
    need a fully virtualized per jail network stack set it to off.

    Default: auto-guess
    Source: local

  bpf=on | off

    This controls whether to start the jail with BPF devices enabled.
    Default is off.

    Default: off
    Source: local

  dhcp=on | off

    This controls whether to start the jail with DHCP.
    Default is off, but if you want it on, vnet and bpf are required.

    Default: off
    Source: local

  ip4_addr="interface|ip-address/netmask"

    The IPv4 address for VNET and shared IP jails.

    Form is: interface|ip-address/netmask
    Multiple interfaces:
    "interface|ip-address/netmask,interface|ip-address/netmask"

    For shared IP jails if an interface is given before
    the IP address, an alias for the address will be added to that
    interface, as it is with the interface parameter. If the DEFAULT
    tag is used instead of an interface, the interface will be
    automatically assigned based upon the system's default interface.

    If a netmask in either dotted-quad or CIDR form is given after IP
    address, it will be used when adding the IP alias.

    If the AUTOIP4 tag is used in place of an ip-address, the IP address
    will be automatically assigned at first start of the jail. This
    requires that the ip4_autostart and ip4_autoend variables are set on
    the 'default' property source. If used, the IP4 address will be set
    to the first available based upon the given range and already created
    jails.

    Example:
      # iocage set ip4_autostart="100" default
      # iocage set ip4_autoend="150" default
      # iocage set ip4_autosubnet="24" default

    This will result in the automatic IPv4 address being assigned in the
    base range of the default network interface. I.E. if the local default
    NIC is set to 192.168.0.XXX, then the new address will be
    192.168.0.[100-150]/24

    For VNET jails the interface will be configured with the IP addresses
    listed.

    Example: "vnet0|192.168.0.10/24,vnet1|10.1.1.10/24"
    This would configure interfaces vnet0 and vnet1 in a VNET jail. In this
    case no network configuration is necessary in the jail's rc.conf file.

    Default: none
    Source: jail(8)

  ip4_saddrsel=1 | 0

    Only takes effect when vnet=off.
    A boolean option to change the formerly mentioned behaviour and
    disable IPv4 source address selection for the prison in favour of
    the primary IPv4 address of the jail.  Source address selection
    is enabled by default for all jails and the ip4_nosaddrsel
    settting of a parent jail is not inherited for any child jails.

    Default: 1
    Source: jail(8)

  ip4=new | disable | inherit

    Only takes effect when vnet=off.
    Control the availability of IPv4 addresses.  Possible values are
    "inherit" to allow unrestricted access to all system addresses,
    "new" to restrict addresses via ip4.addr above, and "disable" to
    stop the jail from using IPv4 entirely.  Setting the ip4.addr
    parameter implies a value of "new".

    Default: new
    Source: jail(8)

  defaultrouter=none | ipaddress

    Setting this property to anything other than none will try to configure a
    default route inside a VNET jail.

  defaultrouter6=none | ip6address

    Setting this property to anything other than none will try to configure a
    default IPv6 route inside a VNET jail.

  resolver=none | nameserver IP;nameserver IP;search domain.local

    Sets the jail's resolver (resolv.conf). Fields must be ; delimited
    which are translated to newlines in resolv.conf.

    If the resolver is set to none (default) the jail will inherit
    the hosts resolv.conf file.

  ip6.addr, ip6.saddrsel, ip6

    A set of IPv6 options for the prison, the counterparts to
    ip4.addr, ip4.saddrsel and ip4 above.

  interfaces=vnet0:bridge0,vnet1:bridge1 | vnet0:bridge0

    By default there are two interfaces specified with their bridge
    association. Up to four interfaces are supported. Interface configurations
    are separated by commas. Format is interface:bridge, where left value is
    the virtual VNET interface name, right value is the bridge name where the
    virtual interface should be attached.

    Default: vnet0:bridge0,vnet1:bridge1
    Source: local

  host_hostname=UUID

    The hostname of the jail.

    Default: UUID
    Source: jail(8)

  exec_fib=0 | 1 ..

    The FIB (routing table) to set when running commands inside the jail.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  devfs_ruleset=4 | 0 ..

    The number of the devfs ruleset that is enforced for mounting
    devfs in this jail.  A value of zero (default) means no ruleset
    is enforced.  Descendant jails inherit the parent jail's devfs
    ruleset enforcement.  Mounting devfs inside a jail is possible
    only if the allow_mount and allow_mount_devfs permissions are
    effective and enforce_statfs is set to a value lower than 2.
    Devfs rules and rulesets cannot be viewed or modified from inside
    a jail.

    NOTE: It is important that only appropriate device nodes in devfs
    be exposed to a jail; access to disk devices in the jail may permit
    processes in the jail to bypass the jail sandboxing by modifying
    files outside of the jail.  See devfs(8) for information on
    how to use devfs rules to limit access to entries in the per-jail
    devfs.  A simple devfs ruleset for jails is available as ruleset
    #4 in /etc/defaults/devfs.rules

    Default: 4
    Source: jail(8)

  mount_devfs=1 | 0

    Mount a devfs(5) filesystem on the chrooted /dev directory, and
    apply the ruleset in the devfs_ruleset parameter (or a default of
    ruleset 4: devfsrules_jail) to restrict the devices visible
    inside the jail.

    Default: 1
    Source: jail(8)

  exec_start="/bin/sh /etc/rc"

    Command(s) to run in the prison environment when a jail is created.
    A typical command to run is "sh /etc/rc".

    Default: /bin/sh /etc/rc
    Source: jail(8)

  exec_stop="/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown"

    Command(s) to run in the prison environment before a jail is
    removed, and after any exec_prestop commands have completed.
    A typical command to run is "sh /etc/rc.shutdown".

    Default: /bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown
    Source: jail(8)

  exec_prestart="/usr/bin/true"

    Command(s) to run in the system environment before a jail is started.

    Default: /usr/bin/true
    Source: jail(8)

  exec_prestop="/usr/bin/true"

    Command(s) to run in the system environment before a jail is stopped.

    Default: /usr/bin/true
    Source: jail(8)

  exec_poststop="/usr/bin/true"

    Command(s) to run in the system environment after a jail is stopped.

    Default: /usr/bin/true
    Source: jail(8)

  exec_poststart="/usr/bin/true"

    Command(s) to run in the system environment after a jail is started,
    and after any exec_start commands have completed.

    Default: /usr/bin/true
    Source: jail(8)

  exec_clean=1 | 0

    Run commands in a clean environment.  The environment is discarded
    except for HOME, SHELL, TERM and USER.  HOME and SHELL are
    set to the target login's default values.  USER is set to the
    target login.  TERM is imported from the current environment.
    The environment variables from the login class capability database
    for the target login are also set.

    Default: 1
    Source: jail(8)

  exec_timeout=60 | 30 ..

    The maximum amount of time to wait for a command to complete.  If
    a command is still running after this many seconds have passed,
    the jail will be terminated.

    Default: 60
    Source: jail(8)

  stop_timeout=30 | 60 ..

    The maximum amount of time to wait for a jail's processes to
    exit after sending them a SIGTERM signal (which happens after the
    exec_stop commands have completed).  After this many seconds have
    passed, the jail will be removed, which will kill any remaining
    processes. If this is set to zero, no SIGTERM is sent and the
    prison is immediately removed.

    Default: 30
    Source: jail(8)

  exec_jail_user=root

    The user to run commands as, when running in the jail environment.

    Default: root
    Source:  jail(8)

  exec_system_jail_user=0 | 1

    This boolean option looks for the exec_jail_user in the system
    passwd(5) file, instead of in the jail's file.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  exec_system_user=root

    The user to run commands as, when running in the system environment.
    The default is to run the commands as the current user.

    Default: root
    Source: jail(8)

  mount_fdescfs=1 | 0

    Mount a fdescfs(5) filesystem in the jail's /dev/fd directory.
    Note: This is not supported on FreeBSD 9.3.

    Default: 1
    Source: jail(8)

  mount_procfs=0 | 1

    Mount a procfs(5) filesystem in the jail's /dev/proc directory.

    Default: 0
    Source: local

  mount_linprocfs=0 | 1

    Mount a linprocfs(5) filesystem in the jail's /compat/linux/proc directory.

    Default: 0
    Source: local

  enforce_statfs=2 | 1 | 0

    This determines which information processes in a jail are able to
    get about mount points.  It affects the behaviour of the following
    syscalls: statfs(2), fstatfs(2), getfsstat(2) and fhstatfs(2)
    (as well as similar compatibility syscalls).  When set to 0, all
    mount points are available without any restrictions.  When set to 1,
    only mount points below the jail's chroot directory are visible
    In addition to that, the path to the jail's chroot directory
    is removed from the front of their pathnames.  When set to 2
    (default), above syscalls can operate only on a mount-point where
    the jail's chroot directory is located.

    Default: 2. jail(8)

  children_max=0 | ..

    The number of child jails allowed to be created by this jail (or
    by other jails under this jail). This limit is zero by default,
    indicating the jail is not allowed to create child jails.  See
    the Hierarchical Jails section for more information in jail(8).

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  login_flags="-f root"

    Supply these flags to login when logging in to jails with the console
    function.

    Default: -f root
    Source: login(1)

  jail_zfs=on | off

    Enables automatic ZFS jailing inside the jail. Assigned ZFS dataset will
    be fully controlled by the jail.
    NOTE: Setting this to "on" automatically enables allow_mount=1
    enforce_statfs=1 and allow_mount_zfs=1! These are dependent options
    required for ZFS management inside a jail.

    Default: off
    Source: local

  jail_zfs_dataset=iocage/jails/UUID/root/data | zfs_filesystem

    This is the dataset to be jailed and fully handed over to a jail. Takes
    the ZFS filesystem name without pool name.
    NOTE: only valid if jail_zfs=on. By default the mountpoint is set to none,
    to mount this dataset set its mountpoint inside the jail i.e. "zfs set
    mountpoint=/data full-dataset-name" and issue "mount -a".

    Default: iocage/jails/UUID/root/data
    Source: local

  securelevel=3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | -1

    The value of the jail's kern.securelevel sysctl.  A jail never
    has a lower securelevel than the default system, but by setting
    this parameter it may have a higher one.  If the system
    securelevel is changed, any jail securelevels will be at least as
    secure.

    Default: 2
    Source: jail(8)

  allow_set_hostname=1 | 0

    The jail's hostname may be changed via hostname(1) or sethostname(3).

    Default: 1
    Source: jail(8)

  allow_sysvipc=0 | 1

    A process within the jail has access to System V IPC
    primitives.  In the current jail implementation, System V
    primitives share a single namespace across the host and
    jail environments, meaning that processes within a jail
    would be able to communicate with (and potentially interfere
    with) processes outside of the jail, and in other jails.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  allow_raw_sockets=0 | 1

    The prison root is allowed to create raw sockets.  Setting
    this parameter allows utilities like ping(8) and
    traceroute(8) to operate inside the prison.  If this is
    set, the source IP addresses are enforced to comply with
    the IP address bound to the jail, regardless of whether
    or not the IP_HDRINCL flag has been set on the socket.
    Since raw sockets can be used to configure and interact
    with various network subsystems, extra caution should be
    used where privileged access to jails is given out to
    untrusted parties.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  allow_chflags=0 | 1

    Normally, privileged users inside a jail are treated as
    unprivileged by chflags(2).  When this parameter is set,
    such users are treated as privileged, and may manipulate
    system file flags subject to the usual constraints on
    kern.securelevel.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  allow_mount=0 | 1

    privileged users inside the jail will be able to mount
    and unmount file system types marked as jail-friendly.
    The lsvfs(1) command can be used to find file system
    types available for mount from within a jail.  This permission
    is effective only if enforce_statfs is set to a
    value lower than 2.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  allow_mount_devfs=0 | 1

    privileged users inside the jail will be able to mount
    and unmount the devfs file system.  This permission is
    effective only together with allow.mount and if
    enforce_statfs is set to a value lower than 2.  Please
    consider restricting the devfs ruleset with the
    devfs_ruleset option.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  allow_mount_nullfs=0 | 1

    privileged users inside the jail will be able to mount
    and unmount the nullfs file system. This permission is
    effective only together with allow_mount and if
    enforce_statfs is set to a value lower than 2.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  allow_mount_procfs=0 | 1

    privileged users inside the jail will be able to mount
    and unmount the procfs file system.  This permission is
    effective only together with allow.mount and if
    enforce_statfs is set to a value lower than 2.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  allow_mount_tmpfs=0 | 1

    privileged users inside the jail will be able to mount
    and unmount the tmpfs file system.  This permission is
    effective only together with allow.mount and if
    enforce_statfs is set to a value lower than 2.
    Note: This is not supported on FreeBSD 9.3.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  allow_mount_zfs=0 | 1

    privileged users inside the jail will be able to mount
    and unmount the ZFS file system.  This permission is
    effective only together with allow.mount and if
    enforce_statfs is set to a value lower than 2.  See
    zfs(8) for information on how to configure the ZFS
    filesystem to operate from within a jail.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  allow_quotas=0 | 1

    The jail root may administer quotas on the jail's
    filesystem(s). This includes filesystems that the jail
    may share with other jails or with non-jailed parts of
    the system.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  allow_socket_af=0 | 1

    Sockets within a jail are normally restricted to IPv4,
    IPv6, local (UNIX), and route.  This allows access to
    other protocol stacks that have not had jail functionality
    added to them.

    Default: 0
    Source: jail(8)

  host_hostuuid=UUID

    Default: UUID
    Source: jail(8)

  tag="any string"

    Custom string for aliasing jails. Must be unique.

    Default: date@time
    Source: local

  template=yes | no

    This property controls whether the jail is a template. Templates are not
    started by iocage. Set to yes if you intend to convert jail into template.
    (See EXAMPLES section)

    Default: no
    Source: local

  boot=on | off

    If set to "on" jail will be auto-started at boot time (rcboot subcommand)
    and stopped at shutdown time (rcshutdown subcommand). Jails will be started
    and stopped based on their priority value.

    Default: off
    Source: local

  notes="any string"

    Custom notes for miscellaneous tagging.

    Default: none
    Source: local

  owner=root

    The owner of the jail, can be any string.

    Default: root
    Source: local

  priority=99:0
    Start priority at boot time, smaller value means higher priority.
    Also, for shutdown the order will be reversed.

    Default: 99. Max: 99. Lowest: 0.

    Anything set to 99 will automatically start in the background parallel
    with other jails set to 99. Anything less than 99 will start sequentially.

  last_started

    Last successful start time. Auto set every time jail starts.

    Default: timestamp
    Source: local

  type=basejail

    Currently only basejails, gitjails and empty jails are supported.

    Default: basejail
    Source: local

  hostid=UUID

    The UUID of the host node. Jails won't start if this property differs from
    the actual UUID of the host node. This is to safeguard jails from being
    started on different nodes in case they are periodically replicated across.

    Default: UUID of the host (taken from /etc/hostid)
    Source: local

  release=10.0-RELEASE | 9.2-RELEASE

    The RELEASE used at creation time. Can be set to any string if needed.

    Default: the host's RELEASE
    Source: local

  compression=on | off | lzjb | gzip | gzip-N | zle | lz4

    Controls the compression algorithm used for this dataset. The lzjb
    compression algorithm is optimized for performance while providing
    decent data compression. Setting compression to on uses the lzjb
    compression algorithm. The gzip compression algorithm uses the same
    compression as the gzip(1) command. You can specify the gzip level by using
    the value gzip-N where N is an integer from 1 (fastest) to 9 (best
    compression ratio). Currently, gzip is equivalent to gzip-6 (which is also
    the default for gzip(1)).  The zle compression algorithm compresses runs of
    zeros.

    The lz4 compression algorithm is a high-performance replacement for
    the lzjb algorithm. It features significantly faster compression and
    decompression, as well as a moderately higher compression ratio than
    lzjb, but can only be used on pools with the lz4_compress feature set
    to enabled.  See zpool-features(7) for details on ZFS feature flags
    and the lz4_compress feature.

    This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name
    compress.  Changing this property affects only newly-written data.

    Default: lz4
    Source: zfs(8)

  origin

    This is only set for clones. Read-only.
    For cloned file systems or volumes, the snapshot from which the clone
    was created. See also the clones property.

    Default: -
    Source: zfs(8)

  quota=15G | 50G | ..

    Quota for jail.
    Limits the amount of space a dataset and its descendents can consume.
    This property enforces a hard limit on the amount of space used. This
    includes all space consumed by descendents, including file systems
    and snapshots. Setting a quota on a descendent of a dataset that
    already has a quota does not override the ancestor's quota, but
    rather imposes an additional limit.

    Default: none
    Source: zfs(8)

  mountpoint

    Path for the jail's root filesystem. Don't tweak this or jail won't start!

    Default: set to jail's root
    Source: zfs(8)

  compressratio

    Compression ratio. Read-only.
    For non-snapshots, the compression ratio achieved for the used space
    of this dataset, expressed as a multiplier.  The used property
    includes descendant datasets, and, for clones, does not include the
    space shared with the origin snapshot.

    Source: zfs(8)

  available

    Available space in jail's dataset.
    The amount of space available to the dataset and all its children,
    assuming that there is no other activity in the pool. Because space
    is shared within a pool, availability can be limited by any number of
    factors, including physical pool size, quotas, reservations, or other
    datasets within the pool.

    Source: zfs(8)

  used

    Used space by jail. Read-only.
    The amount of space consumed by this dataset and all its descendents.
    This is the value that is checked against this dataset's quota and
    reservation. The space used does not include this dataset's reservation,
    but does take into account the reservations of any descendent
    datasets. The amount of space that a dataset consumes from its parent,
    as well as the amount of space that are freed if this dataset is
    recursively destroyed, is the greater of its space used and its
    reservation.

    When snapshots (see the "Snapshots" section) are created, their space
    is initially shared between the snapshot and the file system, and
    possibly with previous snapshots. As the file system changes, space
    that was previously shared becomes unique to the snapshot, and
    counted in the snapshot's space used. Additionally, deleting snapshots
    can increase the amount of space unique to (and used by) other
    snapshots.

    The amount of space used, available, or referenced does not take into
    account pending changes. Pending changes are generally accounted for
    within a few seconds. Committing a change to a disk using fsync(2) or
    O_SYNC does not necessarily guarantee that the space usage information
    is updated immediately.

    Source:  zfs(8)

  dedup=on | off | verify | sha256[,verify]

    Deduplication for jail.
    Configures deduplication for a dataset. The default value is off.
    The default deduplication checksum is sha256 (this may change in the
    future).  When dedup is enabled, the checksum defined here overrides
    the checksum property. Setting the value to verify has the same
    effect as the setting sha256,verify.

    If set to verify, ZFS will do a byte-to-byte comparsion in case of
    two blocks having the same signature to make sure the block contents
    are identical.

    Default: off.
    Source: zfs(8)

  reservation=size | none

    Reserved space for jail.
    The minimum amount of space guaranteed to a dataset and its descendents.
    When the amount of space used is below this value, the dataset
    is treated as if it were taking up the amount of space specified by
    its reservation. Reservations are accounted for in the parent
    datasets' space used, and count against the parent datasets' quotas
    and reservations.

    Default: none
    Source: zfs(8)

  sync_target

    This is for future use, currently not supported.

  sync_tgt_zpool

    This is for future use, currently not supported.

  rlimits=on | off

    If set to "on" resource limits will be enforced.

    Default: off
    Source: local

  cpuset=1 | 1,2,3,4 | 1-2 | off

    Controls the jail's CPU affinity. For more details please refer to
    cpuset(1).

    Default: off
    Source: cpuset(1)

RESOURCE LIMITS
  Resource limits (except cpuset and rlimits) use the following value
  field formatting in the property: limit:action.

  Limit defines how much of the resource a process can use before the
  defined action triggers.

  Action defines what will happen when a process exceeds the allowed
  amount.

  Valid actions are:
        deny    deny the allocation; not supported for cpu and
                wallclock
        log     log a warning to the console
        devctl  send notification to devd(8)
        sig*    e.g. sigterm; send a signal to the offending
                process

  To better understand what this means please read rctl(8)
  before enabling any limits.

  The following resource limits are supported:

  memoryuse=limit:action | off

    Limits the resident set size (DRAM).

    Default: 8G:log

EXAMPLES
  Set up iocage from scratch:

    iocage fetch

  Create first jail:

    iocage create tag=myjail

  List jails:

    iocage list

  Start jail:

    iocage start UUID

  Turn on resource limits and apply them:

    iocage set rlimits=on UUID
    iocage cap UUID

  Display resource usage:

    iocage inuse UUID

  Convert jail into template:

    iocage set template=yes UUID

  List templates:

    iocage list -t

  Clone jail from template:

    iocage clone UUID-of-template tag=myjail

  Import package on another host

    iocage import UUID

  Get the last successful start time for all jails

    iocage get -r last_started

HINTS
  iocage marks a ZFS pool in the pool's comment field and identifies the
  active pool for use based on this string.

  If using VNET don't forget to add the node's physical NIC into one
  of the bridges if you need an outside connection. Also read bridge(4)
  to see how traffic is handled if you are not familiar with this concept
  (in a nutshell: bridge behaves like a network switch).

  PF firewall is not supported inside VNET jails as of July 2014. PF can be
  enabled for the host however. IPFW is fully supported inside a VNET jail.

  Property validation is not handled by iocage (to keep it simple) so please
  make sure your property values are supported before configuring any
  properties.

  The actual jail name in the jls(8) output is set to ioc-UUID. This is a
  required workaround as jails will refuse to start with jail(8) when name
  starts with a "0".

  To prevent dmesg leak inside jails apply the following sysctl:

    security.bsd.unprivileged_read_msgbuf=0

  If using VNET consider applying these sysctl's as well:

    net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
    net.link.bridge.pfil_onlyip=0
    net.link.bridge.pfil_bridge=0
    net.link.bridge.pfil_member=0
