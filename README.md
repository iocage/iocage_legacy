**QUICK HOWTO:**

Fetch a release:

`iocage fetch`

Create a jail:

**USAGE**

See [iocage.8.txt](iocage.8.txt)

**REQUIREMENTS**
- FreeBSD 9.3-RELEASE amd64 or newer
- ZFS file system
- Optional - Kernel compiled with:

        # This is optional and only needed if you need VNET and resource
        # limits

        options         VIMAGE # VNET/Vimage support
        options         RACCT  # Resource containers
        options         RCTL   # same as above

**OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**
- For resource limiting please read rctl(8)
- For the explanations on jail properties read jail(8)
- Create bridge0 and bridge1 interfaces

**HINTS**
- Use iocage set/get to modify properties
- To understand what most properties do read iocage(8).
- If using VNET consider adding the following to `/etc/sysctl.conf` on the host:

        net.inet.ip.forwarding=1       # Enable IP forwarding between interfaces
        net.link.bridge.pfil_onlyip=0  # Only pass IP packets when pfil is enabled
        net.link.bridge.pfil_bridge=0  # Packet filter on the bridge interface
        net.link.bridge.pfil_member=0  # Packet filter on the member interface
